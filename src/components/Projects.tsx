          "I can't take credit for final deliverables â€“ my role in this was ideating, shaping and validating the features that would become Luxe. Once the teams we needed help from got involved, I handed over each feature to the relevant designer and was just there to provide guidance so they hit the mark.",

          "We actually have a funny problem where most customers use our current top tier product - making it not very top tier.",
          "Given we only really deliver new value to this tier, it leaves a bunch of lower customers in the lurch. So, adding this new tier is the first step in creating a simpler and fairer product suite.",
          "Giving customers a way to go up a level allows us to retire a now mid-range product, merge a few lower value products and redistribute the value we provide at each tier more evenly.",
